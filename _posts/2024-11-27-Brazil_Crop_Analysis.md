# Data Analysis of Crops Grown in Brazil

## Introduction
Brazil is one of the top five countries for crop output in 2020. As per 2020, the agriculture sector which includes crop contributed a significant portion of Brazil’s GDP. In this analysis we will see which crops did the best in Brazil’s economy from 1961 – 2020.


### Crop Distribution for Brazil in 2020

**Show the top 15 crops Brazil has produced and the total yield in 2020**

>The top three crops that gave the highest crop yield 2020 for Brazil were sugarcane, tomatoes, and papaya.

### Yearly Change in Total Area Harvested

>In the beginning years, Brazil’s total area harvested for sugarcane was steady. From 1975 onwards they rapidly began to increase the amount of land from which sugarcane was gathered. We can see that the total area under cultivation has almost grown over 7.3 times from 1960 to 2020.

### Sugarcane
>Seeing as how sugarcane has came up in the top three for all three categories, we will now look at how sugarcane has varied over the years.

**Production x Year of sugarcane**

>Comparing Brazil to Peru, we can see that Peru produced 1.2 million sugarcanes in 2020. While Brazil produced a little over 750 thousand sugarcanes in 2020. Based on the numbers in 2020, Peru is outproducing Brazil. However, looking at Peru’s output yearly we can see from 1961 – 2020 their production of sugarcane has fallen 19% throughout the years. On the other hand, Brazil has increased their production from 1961 – 2020 by 74%. In 1961, Peru was producing sugarcane 3.6 times more than Brazil. In 2020, Peru is only producing sugarcane 1.6 times more than Brazil. If Peru continues to produce less sugarcane and Brazil steadily increases their production the tide may change to Brazil becoming the lead producer for sugarcane.

**Yield x Year of sugarcane compared to the top competitor**
>The yield for sugarcane per year follows a similar upward trend in the area harvested yearly. They started out with steady numbers and from 1975 onwards they increased their yield amount of sugarcane. We can see that the total yield from 1960 to 2020 has grown 12.75 times.

## Conclusion
Brazil has done well for themselves in growing sugarcane as their top crop. For 2020, Brazil’s top cultivated areas were soybeans, maize and sugar cane. Their top crop production were sugar cane, soybeans, and maize. The highest harvest production in 2020 were soybeans, maize and sugar cane. The crop that placed in the top three for each category was sugarcane. Looking over how they did over the years. The total area under cultivation has almost grown over 7.3 times from 1960 to 2020. The production of sugarcane in Peru in 2020 is 1.6 times more than Brazil. To be the leader in producing sugarcane, Brazil needs to improve on its productivity of sugarcane to catch up to Peru.
